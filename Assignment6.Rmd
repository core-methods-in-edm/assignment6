#Addignment 6

In this assignment you will be looking at data from a MOOC. It contains the following per-student variables:

certified (yes/no) - Whether or not a student paid for the course  
forum.posts (numeric) - How many forum posts a student made throughout the course  
grade (numeric) - A student's average grade for the course exam  
assignment (numeric) - A student's average grade for the course assignments

# There's no difference between 1 and 1_1, and I wonder if it is necessary to scale them
# The influence of forum.posts is too great, so I decided to delete it from the 3 variables
```

#The heading "xerror" in the printcp table stands for "cross validation error", it is the error rate of assigning students to certified/uncertified of the model averaged over 10-fold cross validation. CP stands for "Cost Complexity" and represents the cost in error for adding a node to the tree. Notice it decreases as we add more nodes to the tree which implies that more nodes make better predictions. However, more nodes also mean that we may be making the model less generalizable, this is known as "overfitting".

#If we are worried about overfitting we can remove nodes form our tree using the prune() command, setting cp to the CP value from the table that corresponds to the number of nodes we want the tree to terminate at. Let's set it to two nodes.

```{r}
c.tree2 <- prune(c.tree1_2, cp =0.059)#Set cp to the level at which you want the tree to end

#Visualize this tree and compare it to the one you generated earlier

post(c.tree2, file = "tree2.ps", title = "MOOC") #This creates a pdf image of the tree
```

#Now use both the original tree and the pruned tree to make predictions about the the students in the second data set. Which tree has a lower error rate?

```{r}
M2$predict1 <- predict(c.tree1_2, M2, type = "class")

M2$predict2 <- predict(c.tree2, M2, type = "class")

tab1 <- table(M2$certified, M2$predict1)
tab1
tab2 <- table(M2$certified, M2$predict2)
tab2

precision1 <- (tab1[1,1] + tab1[2,2]) / nrow(M2)
precision2 <- (tab2[1,1] + tab2[2,2]) / nrow(M2)

precision1
precision2

#precision2 has a lower error rate
